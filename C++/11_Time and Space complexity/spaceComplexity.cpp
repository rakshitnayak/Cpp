/* space required as a function of input size.

if an additional space is required,that is called
as auxillary space,hence

1) only thin about auxillary space
2) at any point of time maximum memory u are using is used to calculate space complexity
3) In Case of recusrion we have always have some space complexity which are waiting.
   other functions to get executed. 
   ex: in factorial n,n-1,n-2 all keep waiting until n=0; hence kn is space complexity
   with O(n)
